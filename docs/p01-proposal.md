### Abstract:
We are concerned with the relationships between hospital closures, medical debt, health professional shortages, and life expectancy, with a specific focus on how healthcare resource distribution affects healthcare outcomes. This is important because without clearly understanding where healthcare resources need to be reinforced and where health inequities are the most severe, we will not be able to take the first steps towards a healthcare system that works for all Americans. To address this concern, we intend to understand geographical differences in each of the above mentioned variables (hospital closures, etc.) and unearth statistical trends between variables that in turn help us draw conclusions in regards to the ways in which the different variables contribute to health outcomes across different geographies.


### Keywords:
Hospital closures; medical debts; health professional shortages; life expectancy; health inequity.

### Introduction:
For the past two years COVID-19 has ravaged communities across America. COVID-19 has highlighted the many short-comings of the American healthcare system, but none more so than the disparities Americans of different walks of life face when interacting with the healthcare system. However these disparities are not new at all, they have had an extensive history within the healthcare system and even after numerous efforts to understand these disparities and address them, they continue to remain one of the most pervasive problems that face the American healthcare system. One of the reasons this problem is so pervasive is because of the many different factors that affect an individual’s health, from the zip code they live in to the amount of debt they live in to the number of hospitals near them. Understanding how much these factors contribute to an individual’s health is a small step to addressing these inequities and that is exactly what this project is: a small step in addressing the inequities in healthcare by visualizing and connecting data.

### Problem Domain:


### Research Questions:


### Datasets:

#### Rural Hospital Closures by Counties:


#### Medical Debt in America by Counties:

We chose to look at a dataset of average medical debt at the county levels because we wanted to know if one’s medical debt is a factor to rural hospital closures as we were speculating that hospitals cannot generate revenue if patients cannot afford or pay their medical bills.

These data are collected by Alexander Carther, Kassandra Martinchek, Breno Braga, Signe-Mary McKernan, and Caleb Quakenbush, the creators of the project “Debt in America”. They started this project because they wanted to show the debt differences that can reinforce the wealth gap between white communities and communities of color. They collected data from major credit bureaus from February 2022 and US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey from 2015 to 2019. The data collection effort was funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Ford Foundation. The data is trustworthy as the Urban Institute is a highly respected nonprofit research organization. Communities of color are likely to benefit from the data as the dataset shed light on the wealth differences between white communities and communities of color. We obtained the data by searching about medical debt in America on Google.

#### Healthcare Professional Shortages by Counties:
The data was collected by HRSA, Health Resources & Service Administration since 2006. HRSA is funded with annual appropriations of $13.3 billion in their fiscal year, 2022. The purpose of the data is to decide whether or not the area is a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). More than 34 federal programs depend on this data collection of HPSA designations. They use the data in order to determine eligibility or even as a funding preference. From this, the areas that are HPSA will be benefited from the funds that are given based on the data. The data is trustworthy because not only the data itself is very recent but the HRSA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which is an executive branch department of the U.S. federal government. We obtained the data through researching on Google, and we did credit the source of the data accordingly.


#### Life Expectancy at Birth in America by Counties:

We chose to look at the life expectancy at birth at the county level because we want to see if there is a difference in life expectancy between metro and nonmetro areas and to help identify the impact of living in a rural area to one’s overall health.

These data were collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) from the National Center for Health Statistics’ 2000-2019 data (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm) of population and deaths data in the United States. This was collected in 2019 for the purpose of estimating mortality rates and life expectancy at the county level. This data collection was funded by National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI) (United States), National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This data is likely to benefit the minority communities as the data provides insights to health differences between different communities. This data is trustworthy because the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities is a government health institute. We obtained the data by searching on Google and we did credit the source of the data.
