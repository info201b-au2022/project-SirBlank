## Introduction


## Summary


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
source("../source/aggregate_table_script_b.3.R")
# data_access_test()
```

## Table

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


<center> <h3> __Top Ten Counties in the US with Highest Percentage of Medical Debt in 2022__ <h3> </center>


&nbsp;

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
# msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
medical_debt_table_10 <- medical_debt_DT
knitr::kable(medical_debt_table_10, format = "pipe")
```
This table is grouped by the ten highest percentage of medical debt. Greene County, a non-metropolitan county, in North Carolina has the highest share with medical debt of 43.8% in the United States. The table shows that 9 out of 10 counties with highest percentage of medical debt are non-metropolitan counties. We also noticed that all of the counties in the table are located in Southern or Eastern United States.

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
